Welcome to my new blog! This is a sample post to test the layout and styling.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a minimal, fast blog where I can share technical thoughts, ideas, and experiments. After considering several options, I chose **Eleventy (11ty)** because:

- It's simple and lightweight
- No complex dependencies
- Full control over the output
- Fast build times

## Features

Here's what this blog supports:

- **Markdown** for writing posts
- **Images and gifs** in posts
- **Syntax highlighting** for code blocks
- **RSS feed** for subscription
- **Clean, readable typography**

## Code Example

```javascript
function hello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

hello("World");
```

## Links and References

You can find more information about 11ty at the [official website](https://www.11ty.dev).

## Conclusion

This is just the beginning. I'll be posting more content regularly about technical topics, experiments, and thoughts.

Stay tuned!
